    <ul>
        <li>Chicken broth/stock</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Dark soy sauce</li>

        <h3> Steps to make it!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Combine all ingredients for the chicken in a shallow bowl; cover and marinate for 10 minutes (if time allows).</li>
        <Li>2. Whisk sauce ingredients together until sugar dissolves; set aside</li>
        <li>3. Heat a large skillet, pan or wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, allow to heat up, then add marinated chicken. 
            Fry chicken for 3-4 minutes while occasionally stirring, until edges are browned. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>4. Add remaining cooking oil into the same pan/wok. Stir in garlic, ginger, chili diced peppers (capsicums) 
            and Sichuan peppercorns and stir fry for 1 minute. </li>
        <li>5. Give the prepared sauce a mix, then pour it into the pan and bring it to a boil while stirring. </li>
        <li>6.  Once it begins to thicken slightly, 
            add chicken back into the pan/wok and mix all of the ingredients through the sauce until the chicken is evenly coated and sauce has thickened, 
            (about 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>7.  Stir in green onions, peanuts and sesame oil. Toss well and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes to infuse all of the flavours together.  </li>
        <li>8.  Serve immediately with steamed/cooked rice or fried rice!  </li>
    </ol>
